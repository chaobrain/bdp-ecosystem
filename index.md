# Brain Dynamics Programming Ecosystem 


We are building an ecosystem for general-purpose bain dynamics programming (BDP).

The BDP ecosystem is a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that can be used to build brain dynamics applications.

The BDP ecosystem is designed to be modular, so you can use as much or as little of it as you need.

## brainunit


[``brainunit``](https://github.com/chaoming0625/brainunit) is a core component of the Brain Dynamics Programming (BDP) 
ecosystem. It provides a comprehensive unit system designed specifically for high-performance computing. The primary 
goal of `brainunit` is to facilitate the creation, manipulation, and analysis of brain dynamics models by offering a 
robust and flexible unit framework.

Key Features:

- **Modular Design**: brainunit is built to be highly modular, allowing users to integrate it seamlessly with other components of the BDP ecosystem.
- **Ease of Use**: With a user-friendly API, brainunit simplifies the process of defining and working with various units in brain dynamics programming.
- **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be easily extensible, enabling users to add custom units and functionalities as needed.

Whether you are developing simple brain dynamics models or complex simulations, brainunit provides the essential tools and functionalities to support your work.
